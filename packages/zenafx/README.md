# zenafx (`zfx`)

An experimental runtime for running graphical WebAssembly components with
Wasmtime, `wasi-gfx`, and `wasi:webgpu`.

```bash
zfx app.wasm
zfx --invoke start app.wasm
zfx -g app.wasm             # turn off Cranelift inlining for readable backtraces
```

## Overview

`zenafx` (`zfx`) runs WebAssembly components that target graphical interfaces.
It provides host-side support for:

- **`wasi:webgpu`**: GPU compute, shader modules, pipelines, command buffers,
  and render passes (backed by `wasi-webgpu-wasmtime` and `wgpu-core`).
- **`wasi-gfx:surface`**: OS window creation, sizing, and event handling
  (`on-frame`, `on-pointer-down`, `on-resize`, etc., backed by
  `surface-wasmtime` and `winit`).
- **`surface-webgpu`**: Presentation context connecting a `Surface` to a WebGPU
  `Device` to present rendered textures.
- **`frame-buffer-wasmtime`**: 2D software framebuffer presentation.
- **`wasi:cli`**: WASI Preview 2 CLI and stdio.

[docs/design/graphical-runtime.md](../../docs/design/graphical-runtime.md).

## Threading Architecture

Operating systems (specifically macOS/AppKit) require window management and OS
events to run on the main process thread. WebAssembly execution under the
Component Model async ABI runs cooperatively on an asynchronous executor.

`zfx` separates these responsibilities across two threads:

1. **Main Thread**: Runs the `winit` window event loop via
   `surface_wasmtime::winit::create_wasi_winit_event_loop()`.
2. **Background Thread**: Runs a Tokio runtime that initializes Wasmtime,
   instantiates the guest component, and executes its asynchronous entry point.
3. **Cross-Thread Dispatch**: `WasiWinitEventLoopProxy` forwards window
   creation, resizing, and input events across threads without blocking the main
   event loop.

## Engine Configuration

The Wasmtime `Engine` inherits Zena's base configuration from `zena-runtime`
(backtrace details, GC collector settings, and compiler inlining) and enables the
Component Model with async support (`wasm_component_model` and
`wasm_component_model_async`).

## Building and Testing

```bash
cargo build --release -p zenafx            # builds target/release/zfx
cargo test -p zenafx                       # runs CLI integration tests (headless-safe)
npm test -w @zena-lang/zenafx              # runs test suite via Wireit

# Run the end-to-end graphical smoke test (opens native window, requires display & GPU):
cargo test -p zenafx -- --ignored
npm run test:gui -w @zena-lang/zenafx
```

## Running the Demo Component

To run the reference WebGPU triangle component:

```bash
./target/release/zfx packages/zenafx/fixtures/triangle.wasm
```
